  # config.mock_with :rr
  config.mock_with :rspec

  # == Fixtures
    #
    # If you're not using ActiveRecord you should remove these
    # lines, delete config/database.yml and disable :active_record
    # in your config/boot.rb
    #
     config.use_transactional_fixtures = true
     config.use_instantiated_fixtures  = false
     config.fixture_path = ::Rails.root.to_s + '/spec/fixtures/'
    #
    # You can declare fixtures for each example_group like this:
    #   describe "...." do
    #     fixtures :table_a, :table_b
    #
    # Alternatively, if you prefer to declare them only once, you can
    # do so right here. Just uncomment the next line and replace the fixture
    # names with your fixtures.
    #
    # config.global_fixtures = :usuarios
    #
    # If you declare global fixtures, be aware that they will be declared
    # for all of your examples, even those that don't use them.
    #
    # You can also declare which fixtures to use (for example fixtures for test/fixtures):
    #
    # config.fixture_path = RAILS_ROOT + '/spec/fixtures/'
    #
